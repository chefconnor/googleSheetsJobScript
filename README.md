# üîç Programmable Job Search Alerts with Google Apps Script

This Google Apps Script runs a powerful custom Google search query to find relevant remote job postings in specific industries (like logistics, retail, or foodservice) and sends them to your Gmail inbox every 30 minutes. The results are also logged into a Google Sheet for tracking and deduplication.

## üì¶ Features

- Uses the [Google Programmable Search Engine (CSE)](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/)

## üß† Who It's For

Ideal for backend developers, data engineers, and job seekers in technical roles (Java/Spring/GCP/etc.) looking for industry-specific, remote opportunities. But anybody can alter it by changing the Custom Google Search to include other domains and changing the search string in the JS file to a boolean search that works for their purposes.
